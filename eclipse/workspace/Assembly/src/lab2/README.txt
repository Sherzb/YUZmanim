ALU/Calculator lab, by Steven Herzberg, done by myself.

After you run the script, the instructions for what to input are given in the console. All inputs
are given without commas or spaces- the 16 bit number "2" is simply 0000000000000010.
The choice of what method to use is given in the console ("For the halfAdder, press 1, etc...").

In addition to printing out the output, the input (arrays) are printed out, and lined up, for easier
comparison. The input arrays are notated as "In1: 0110100.." "In2: 1010110..." etc...

Also, this file imports classes from the Gate class, so make sure to put both of them in the same
folder.
