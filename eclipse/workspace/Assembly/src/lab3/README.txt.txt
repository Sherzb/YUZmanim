Lab 3 by Steven (Shmuel) Herzberg, with help from Eliezer Snow and Ariel Schreier.

All the classes are independently runnable, except for DFFForBit, which is basically a regular DFF, with 
small modifications so that it doesn't print out its own stuff (and the time was adjusted). 

There is no single test script- once run, all the classes are interactive, and the console will prompt you, telling you what you need to input, and will then output based off of that. The DFF and Bit don't take inputs- inputs are randomly generated (and their value is printed out), and will continue to print out output until the program is terminated.
